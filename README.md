# Efficient Parallel Real-time Map Matching Algorithm with High Accuracy
A parallel map matching algorithm which could handle 1,000 matching per second in each thread<br />
Reached 97% accuracy under 5s GPS sampling rate by combining topology of roads and speed of vehicles<br />
Implemented this algorithm on JSTORM distributed platform to achieve parallel computing.
